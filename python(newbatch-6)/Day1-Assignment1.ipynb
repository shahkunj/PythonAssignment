    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "=>Python is a programming language which will be use full for developing Games,Softwares,Database access,Network programing and even used for on server to create web applications and also use for machinelearning, deeplearning,datascience,artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "=>It is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and become famous in 2006 by Google.\n",

    "1. First of all download python3 from the internet.\n",
    "2. Now download the software like pycharm,Anaconda or sublime which you want.(Anaconda is best it contains all the code environment so that it will be easier to use).\n",
    "3. Open Anaconda Navigator.\n",

    "2.What is Code Environment?Types?\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "=>Code Environment is a platform where we can write,compile,run our code easily.And it is of three types.\n",
    "They are,\n",
    "1.Text Editors.\n",
    "2.Full IDEs.\n",
    "3.Notebook Environments.\n",
    "\n",

    "Example: pycharm,spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "=>Notebook Environments: This Environment will be more popular because this provides output line by line and also contains different modes which will provide additional information in our program.\n",
    "Example:Jupyter Notebook."
